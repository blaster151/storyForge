# Scenario: You Cut the Betrayal Scene

**Summary**  
The author removes a pivotal betrayal moment midway through a draft. What happens to character memory, reader alignment, and emotional continuity?

---

## ⚙️ Trigger
> Scene removed: “Chapter 12 — The Knife in the Garden”

## 🧠 System Response (Simulated)
- **Character Memory Thread** reweaves to reinterpret past behavior.
- **Emotional Arc** dips into confusion or flatness without adequate cause.
- **Reader Belief Model** flags contradiction in later trust issues.

## 🔁 Suggested Recalibrations
- Insert foreshadowing fragments elsewhere (Ch. 9? Ch. 11?) to earn the trust breakdown.
- Introduce a new inciting moment that reframes the character’s arc in place of betrayal.

## 📈 Narrative Pressure Test
| Vector             | Status    | Notes                            |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Thematic Resonance | ⚠️ Weak    | “Trust and cost” thread frays    |
| Plot Coherence     | ⚠️ Partial | Timeline gaps introduced         |
| Reader Sympathy    | ✅ Intact  | If confusion is resolved quickly |

## 💭 Notes
Could this be a **semantic decoy** moment? System might surface “truth gaps” as deliberate tension generators.
